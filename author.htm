College football has always been my passion.<br>
As a teenager, I had a Saturday morning ritual in autumn.<br>
I put on the turntable an album of college marching bands.<br>
I played college fight songs on the piano.<br>
I perused "Street & Smiths College Football Magazine".<br>
Organically, I became a fan of the Nebraska Cornhuskers.<br>
I am a native Ohioan, and would eventually graduate as an Ohio Bobcat, but geography has never been important to me in terms of sports.<br>
Once I retired from the information technology industry (specializing in numerous database platforms), I found myself with a lot of time to fill.<br>
I had never been proficient in making predictions, so I decided to delve into the world of metrics, still in its infancy at the time.<br>
The result is what you see on these pages.</p><p>
<a href="https://stassen.com/preseason/prediction-accuracy/2018-5yr.html" target="_blank">5-year period cumulative 2013 through 2017</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp(my predictions are under the name "Cap Heresy")<br>
Hiatus 2018 through 2020<br>
<a href="https://stassen.com/preseason/prediction-accuracy/2024-3yr.html" target="_blank">3-year period cumulative 2021 through 2023</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp(my predictions are under the name "CFB Model by Dunham")<br><br>
Historical prediction accuracy is also referenced in “Phil Steele’s 2024 College Football Preview” magazine on page 7 (see “Dunham /Cap Heresy”).</p></div>
