This innovative college football preseason prediction model has been around since 2011.
It has gone through a few rebrands, starting as "Fort Heresy", becoming "Cap Heresy", and finally moving to its current iteration "CFB Model by Dunham" (MBD).
See the "Author" page for historical accomplishments of the model in terms of prediction accuracy.</p><p>
The core tenet of the model is to devise a power rating system based on what has changed since the end of the previous season.
As a power system, past wins and losses do not matter, with predicted wins and losses coming as an organic output of the power and the schedule.
Only FBS teams are explicitly rated, though FBS vs FCS games are included in the modeling.</p><p>
Data for every metric is converted to a common scale (last season’s final power ratings) in order to quantify and combine.
Duplication caused by overlapping metrics (such as Returning Starts and Seniors) is removed or minimized.</p><p>
Each metric is weighted by using a Pearson correlation coefficient.
A good amount of history is gathered for each metric, and its correlation to a fused Sagarin + Massey power rating is computed across those years.</p><p><span style="border-bottom: 2px solid black">
Four stripes of correlation are computed</span><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value                 of the metric vs the value                 of the power rating (Value-Value)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value                 of the metric vs the year-over-year change of the power rating (Value-Delta)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year-over-year change of the metric vs the value                 of the power rating (Delta-Value)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year-over-year change of the metric vs the year-over-year change of the power rating (Delta-Delta)</p><br><p>
The highest of the four coefficients is used. The stripe of correlation also determines how the metric is converted to the common scale (last season’s final power ratings).</p><p><span style="border-bottom: 2px solid black">
