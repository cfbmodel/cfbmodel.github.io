This innovative college football preseason prediction model has been around since 2011.
It has gone through a few rebrands, starting as "Fort Heresy", becoming "Cap Heresy", and finally moving to its current iteration "CFB Model by Dunham" (MBD).
See the "Author" page for historical accomplishments of the model in terms of prediction accuracy.<br><br>

The core tenet of the model is to devise a power rating system based on what has changed since the end of the previous season.<br>
As a power system, past wins and losses do not matter, with predicted wins and losses coming as an organic output of the power and the schedule.<br>
Only FBS teams are explicitly rated, though FBS vs FCS games are included in the modeling.<br><br><span style="border-bottom: 3px solid black">

Data for every metric is converted to a common scale (last seasonâ€™s final power ratings) in order to quantify and combine.
Duplication caused by overlapping metrics (such as Returning Starts and Seniors) is removed or minimized.<br><br>

as much history as possible, Correlations are computed  types (4), Correlation value (best of 4) used to weight categories.
